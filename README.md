# ETF-Analysis
As a ex-employee in KPMG and have attended many events held by investment banking since I was young with my parents, I developed high curiosity in financial industry.
I have read many books about ETF and stocks, such as the famous "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", "Intelligent Investor",etc. 
Thus, I decided to do a project regarding ETF to see if the findings are just matched up with those books I read.
