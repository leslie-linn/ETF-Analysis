It may be the reason that because of the hugh amount of asset under management and huge number of investers to split the operating expense, thus the operating expense could be lower in percentage compared to those with small amount of asset under management. Thus,we can still study further on the issuer with the highest expense ration, which is Tuttle Tactical Management, LLC, get to know what services it provide to investers so that have such high expense ratio.

    "As we see from the above frquency of distribution, there are lots number of the funds with segment of total market have an asset class of equity, while the second large number of funds with a large cap segement have an asset class of equity as well. Therefore, we can conclude that most of the funds have an asset class of equity. The reason may be that equity is the most common way and more easily to acquire large amount of money to sustain the operations of the funds. Thus, most of the funds have an asset class of equity."

As to both risk averters and risk lovers, I would recommend them choose to invest in U.S. market with equity asset class to have a stable funding ot cash flows to sustain the operating of the funds as well as remain the high quality of monetoring the timely fluctuations in the stock market and quickly make adaption to the funds."

We can see that the top 1 fund is in India market, indicating that India's economy is growing a lot faster than United States.

Further, if the clients are not sure about whether to keep investing tons of money in india market, which is a reletively unstable economic entity compared to the U.S., then it is also a good choice to invest parts of the asset to U.S. market in Mid Cap Value Segment. Last but not least, we noticed that fund with mid cap value segment has a higher 3-month return than with total market, and the reason is that for mid cap value companies, there is still lots potential to grow big faster with lots of visions and hopes within the investers than those of high cap value companies. <br>\n",
